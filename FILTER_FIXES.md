# Filter Issues Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Teacher Filter by Student (Batch 41, Section J) - Lab Section Issue**

**Problem**: When filtering as a teacher by student batch "41" and section "J", the filter only showed students in section "J" but not in lab sections "J1", "J2".

**Root Cause**: The filter logic in `RoutineViewModel.applyFilter()` was using simple string equality matching instead of the enhanced section matching logic used in `RoutineItem.matchesUser()`.

**Solution**: Updated the section matching logic in `FilterType.STUDENT` case to:
- Exact section match (e.g., "J" matches "J")
- Lab section inclusion (e.g., "J" matches "J1", "J2")
- Support for main section filtering that includes all related lab sections

**Files Modified**:
- `RoutineViewModel.kt` - Enhanced section matching logic

### 2. **Case Sensitivity Issue with Teacher Initials**

**Problem**: Teacher initials were being converted to lowercase in the filter, which might not match the stored data format.

**Root Cause**: The filter bottom sheet was forcing teacher initials to lowercase, but the database likely stores them in uppercase.

**Solution**: 
- Changed teacher initial input to uppercase conversion
- Updated placeholder text to show uppercase example ("MBM" instead of "mbm")
- Added proper keyboard capitalization for teacher initial input field

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterRoutinesBottomSheet.kt` - Fixed case handling for teacher initials

## Code Changes Summary

### RoutineViewModel.kt
```kotlin
// Enhanced section matching logic
val sectionMatches = if (filter.section.isNullOrBlank()) {
    true
} else {
    val userSection = filter.section!!.trim().uppercase()
    val itemSection = item.section.trim().uppercase()
    
    when {
        // Exact section match
        itemSection == userSection -> true
        
        // Lab section inclusion (J matches J1, J2)
        userSection.length == 1 && itemSection.startsWith(userSection) && 
        itemSection.length > 1 && itemSection.substring(1).all { it.isDigit() } -> true
        
        else -> false
    }
}
```

### FilterRoutinesBottomSheet.kt
```kotlin
// Teacher initial uppercase conversion
teacherInitial = it.uppercase()

// Enhanced keyboard options
keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(
    keyboardType = KeyboardType.Text,
    capitalization = KeyboardCapitalization.Characters,
    imeAction = ImeAction.Done
)
```

## Expected Results

1. **Lab Section Filtering**: When filtering by batch "41" and section "J", results will now include:
   - Students in section "J"
   - Students in lab sections "J1", "J2"

2. **Teacher Initial Matching**: Teacher initials will be handled in uppercase, ensuring proper matching with database records.

3. **Better User Experience**: 
   - Keyboard automatically capitalizes teacher initials
   - Placeholder shows proper format ("MBM")
   - More intuitive section filtering behavior

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test teacher filter with batch "41" and section "J" - should show J, J1, J2 students
2. Test student filter by teacher initials with both uppercase and lowercase input
3. Verify filter results match expected course names and avoid "Break" instead of course names
4. Test edge cases like single-character sections and multi-digit lab sections
