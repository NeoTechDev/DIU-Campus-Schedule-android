### App-level Integration
The `App` class initializes the reminder scheduler at startup.

## Notification Design

The notifications are designed to match the provided image exactly:

```

   üïê Time: 1:00 PM
   üè¢ Room: 812
   üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher: MIM
   üìö Batch: 41 | Section: J
```

## Features

1. **30-minute advance notifications** - Users receive notifications exactly 30 minutes before each class

4. **Professional error handling** - Comprehensive logging and graceful error recovery
5. **Lifecycle awareness** - Automatically manages reminders based on user authentication

4. Verify notification content and navigation

## Technical Notes

- Implements proper PendingIntent management
- Handles edge cases like past class times
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging
- Follows Android's best practices for background work

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Customizable reminder timing (5, 15, 30 minutes)
- Sound and vibration preferences
