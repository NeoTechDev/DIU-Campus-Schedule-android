## üìä Data Flow

### Normal Operation (Class Routines):
1. App loads class routine from Firebase
2. RoutineScreen displays class schedule
3. Students see their regular class timetable

### Exam Mode Operation:
1. Admin uploads exam routine via dashboard
2. Admin enables exam mode via dashboard toggle
3. Firebase metadata updated with exam mode flag
4. Android app detects exam mode change
5. App switches to display exam routine
6. Students see exam schedule instead of classes
7. Admin can switch back to disable exam mode

### Data Structure:
```json
{
  "examRoutines/{department}": {
    "department": "CSE",
    "days": [
      {
        "date": "2024-12-15",
        "dayName": "Sunday", 
        "courses": [
          {
            "courseCode": "CSE123",
            "courseTitle": "Data Structures",
            "time": "09:00 AM - 12:00 PM",
            "room": "Room 301",
            "teacher": "Dr. Smith",
            "batches": ["55th"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata/routine_version": {
    "examMode": true,
